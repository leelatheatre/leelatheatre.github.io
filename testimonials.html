        <h2>Abhinav Pandey</h2>
        <p>I am one of the lucky person who got the opportunity of making himself , stand unique among the crowd and the thing that helped me  is ‘theatre’. It all happened in my School (St. Anselm’s) when I was in 11th class where we had theatre as a icocurricular activity.</p>
        <p>Initially I was very annoyed with the exercises and games which we played during our classes. But slowly and steadily when I started performing street plays and other plays, I realized the importance of all those games and activities that we did during our process. I found myself more confident, creative, imaginative and skillful. I learned how to manage and utilize time, developed qualities like leadership and coordination and learned how to face challenges in life and solve the problems effectively.</p>
        <p>Now if I go on, it will be a long list of things that have changed my overall personna. But I think it is illustrative to prove and compliment what I said above will be my position as an Assistant Director to Mr. Raju Kumar, the person behind this whole scene, My Director, my friend, my brother……and what not!</p>
        <p>In short I can say that theatre not only makes you a good actor but during the process it indirectly improves your personality, makes you a good human being who is responsible and who works for the welfare of the society and the Nation. And a person with all these qualities in my opinion is a person who stands unique in the crowd and I can proudly say that I am one of them.</p>

        <p>My name is YUDHIRAJ ABHISHEK PARTHI…But who cares whatever my name is. This name was unknown and even the person. But then an angel like GURU came in my life RAJU KUMAR, who gifted me the most beautiful gift of my life and that is "THEATRE". THEATRE completely changed my life. NOW I am more confident, I can take my decisions on my own, I am not afraid of public speaking and now I have the ability to choose what is right and what is wrong for me.</p>
        <p>THEATRE not only teaches you how to act but it also helps in the overall personality development and grooming of a person. People still remember me because of my characters that I used to play in THEATRE. It really gives recognition among people. But after 12th when I wanted to go to MUMABAI for further studies, my percentage (66%) was a big barrier between me and my admission in the best college of MUMBAI. But THEATRE made me enter into MUMBAI's No.1 Commerce College. The cut off was 87%. But my experience in THEATRE and THEATRE certificates helped me to fill the 21% gap and I got admission in that college.</p>
        <p>Thus, THEATRE played a major role in my life. I would really like to thank my GURU RAJU SIR who laid the foundation and made me reach this level.</p>

        <p>THEATRE…. A MAKEOVER!!!!!!!!!</p>
        <p>In this world people go to a designer or to a saloon for getting their makeover but instead of going to these places I rather chose to join theatre. According to me......... makeover is a change not in your physical appearance but how you think.</p>
        <p>My name is Anika Kulshrestha. I’m in 3rd year doing hotel management from seedling college and have been a part of theatre since 2004. I was one of the seven students who got selected from my class for a play to be presented at N.S.D (National School of Drama), Delhi.</p>
        <p>In my school I had commerce and the reason behind it was THEATRE. I was always fascinated by drama but couldn’t get the chance to perform it. In school I was an average student or sometimes may be below average. I use to complain a lot for small things, I showed a lot of attitude to others which was of no use, I was short tempered and end up fighting with anyone without any reason.</p>
        <p>But after joining theatre my life changed - I became more calm and polite, I started scoring good marks and guess what I stood 3rd in my college in first year, 2nd year n waiting for my third year result. I started thinking that others also have some position in the society. My approach towards life has changed a lot. I started forgiving people....... Apart from all these psychological changes, there were many changes in my personality, my confidence level increased; I can speak well in public and many more….</p>
        <p>My life has changed by doing theatre. Every person in his/her lifetime should experience being on stage and performing for public....</p>

        <p>I was a very bright student academically but when it came to showing my talent,I was a zero.Years passed, I cleared my higher secondary and came to class with. 10th July 2004, I had my first Theatre class. That day proved to be the turning point of my life and I have never looked back since then. THEATRE has given me Confidence, Attitude, Dignity and a very strong Will Power.</p>
        <p>It’s been 3 long years since I left school but I am an all new No-par now- SINCERE and CONFIDENT… ready to take challenges and face the world with courage. I don’t fear from loosing but make it a stepping stone for my success and thus stand different from the crowd. Had it not been theatre, I would never been able to discover the real me and would have vanished from this crowded world one day…But now I have made my own identity and attitude and its all because of theatre and my MENTOR Raju Sir.</p>

        <p>Today its complete nine years since we first started theatre. Theatre is something which has given a new horizon to my life. It’s not just a seven letter word for me but it means a lot more than that to me.</p>
        <p>It was in 11th standard when we were introduced to this dream subject. It helped me to create a new identity of my own and changed my way of thinking.</p>
        <p>Because of this I met a great person, Raju sir, full of life, very enthusiastic and hard working and always there to help you out. All in all theatre has completely changed my life, my imagination and my confidence. I have started enjoying life.</p>

        <h2>Ashish Dikshit</h2>
        <p>FROM ‘ANYONE’ TO ‘SOMEONE’</p>
        <p>Theatre.. A word generally associated with stage, artists, melodrama, and most importantly “Entertainment”. But for me the definition goes beyond these terms. Theatre for me is such a platform that not only exposes a person to the outer world but it helps a person to discover his inner talent, shape it in the correct way and then bring it out to the world.</p>
        <p>I look back to those days when I had a phobia of stepping on to the stage, I used to feel inferior while talking to people. I used to feel awkward that except a few friends, no body knew me. That was the time I was searching for my identity. Due to these shortcomings of mine I developed a negative attitude towards life. Even my studies suffered due to these reasons.</p>
        <p>Then a miracle happened. I heard that we are having theatre workshop in our school. I thought that I should give it a try, but I had never imagined that this decision would completely change my life. Earlier it was a bit difficult to convince myself that this is going to help me for becoming a better person. But with the guidance of Raju sir and co-operation of friends, things became easier.</p>
        <p>After joining theatre I was able to rediscover my lost self-confidence, encountered a positive change in my body language, the way I talk to people, the way I greet strangers, my way of expressing things, taking initiative to speak.. Everything improved in an unexpectedly positive manner. And most importantly my attitude towards life changed from being pessimistic to optimistic.</p>
        <p>I have worked in many plays with the unconditional support and guidance of Raju Sir, which has been appreciated by people all around, viz say no to crackers, blood donation, eye donation, entrepreneurship in theatre. I even got an opportunity to act in a play named ‘Commerce In Theatre’ which was selected for being performed at the National School Of Drama, New Delhi.</p>
        <p>I would like to conclude with giving all the credit of transformation of Ashish Dikshit from an “Anyone” to a “Someone”, to theatre, which has not only brought laurels to me, my school and my team but also changed my life, lifestyle and outlook towards life completely.</p>

        <h2>Jenny</h2>
        <p><strong>The Story about a Journey</strong></p>
        <p>This article is rather a story which I would like to share with all of you.</p>
        <p>Seven years ago, a girl shifted from her hometown to a new place. She got an admission in a new school, where nobody knew her, where she knew no one. She felt lonely and lost. Everyday she used to go to the school thinking, today she’ll make new friends, but all of them already had enough friends. Except a few, nobody cared to talk to the new girl. During lunch hours she would sit alone in the classroom and think where to go and with whom to share her lunch with. She knew all this was happening because she was not able to interact with the class. She was a little shy to go and ask anyone to show her around the school or take her in their group. So she kept to herself. Slowly and gradually she started talking to 3-4 students in the class.</p>
        <p>One day, an announcement was made in the class, during the Accounts period, by the teacher, that a workshop will be conducted every Thursday. There was an air of confusion and chaos, as each one of the students thought it might be very boring, as no one had any clue about what it was going to be.</p>
        <p>On the following Thursday that week, the Accounts teacher introduced the class to Mr. Raju Kumar, their Theatre Director! Everyone got excited and thrilled. They didn’t know what was coming ahead, but all they knew was, it’s going to be fun! The Theatre workshops began. Students were set in different small groups always, and were assigned a variety of activities. Slowly and gradually, that girl got to know the names of almost all her classmates. Also they started interacting with her. She made a lot of new friends, now she had lunch with them. She was also introduced to other students in the school, belonging to different streams, like Science. Things were changing for her, she started liking the school and the people around. All the students addressed Mr. Raju as Raju Sir. He told them that soon they would be doing a play which will be enacted for their Accounts subject (School Syllabus). The preparations for the play began. Raju Sir assigned roles and defined characters to all the students. Scripts were written, costumes were designed, dances were choreographed, funds arranged. The show was a huge success, and Raju Sir praised everyone saying this was his best show ever!</p>
        <p>This was just the beginning of the Journey. After that show, there was no stopping or looking back, there were numerous trips, indoor and outdoor, more than 25 shows had been performed, they had become so popular, the word was everywhere…in newspapers, television channels etc. All this affected the girl so much, she got this kind of exposure for the first time in life…she was now recognized by so many people, and she felt like coming out of the cocoon into the real world, her morale had been boasted, she was more confident and outspoken now. She didn’t feel shy speaking to anyone in the class or elsewhere, everyone was her friend now.</p>
        <p>There was a breaking point in her so called theatre career, when the group was supposed to perform a show at National School of Drama (NSD, Delhi), Raju Sir came up to her and asked her, will you play the main role in the enactment “Jesse jays ki naming?” She was surprised, and obviously said, “Yes Sir.” Her world changed after that. She felt like the queen of the world, because she was given such a big responsibility and a chance to exhibit her talent.</p>
        <p>That “Jesse” actually had a makeover then!</p>
        <p>That “Jesse” today is narrating this beautiful story to you all…</p>
        <p>Settled in Dubai (U.A.E), working as Functional Consultant in IT Software Company, I owe a lot to Raju Sir and all my friends who helped me become what I’m today! To help me bring out the actual JENTI TAHILIANI to you! To never be shy or hesitant about anything! To always give your 100% and be sure of yourself in everything you do! To be confident and last but not the least to work as a Team!</p>
        <p>Having an opportunity, I would like to thank, first and foremost, Mr. Raju Kumar and  theatre for making Accountancy such an interesting and easy to understand subject.</p>

H - Hard work<br />
E - Education<br />
A - Awareness<br />
T - Time management<br />
R - Responsible<br />
E - Enjoyable</p>
        <p>Acting is hidden talent in each of us which can come out through theatre which teaches us to be hard working, helps in education, makes us aware of world around; it teaches us value of time, to be a responsible person & also in developing our personality.</p>
        <p>Theatre has changed my life; it turned me from a shy reserve girl to a person with full confidence and has also helped me in overcoming my stage fear. Theatre taught me a lot more. It changed my way of looking the world too .It taught me art of meditation, voice modulation, to cooperate, stage presence, to be confident etc. As the result of our theatre workshop & RAJU SIR we were able to merge theatre with education. It made education easy by converting the subject in a fun & hilarious play, with a dash of songs & dances.</p>
        <p>In the beginning I had to face lots of questions & dissatisfaction among everyone saying ‘Its just wastage of time you must concentrate on your studies.” But after seeing our plays they also changed their view for theatre. And after achieving 88% in 12th boards exams I put a full stop to all the questions pointing to me.</p>
        <p>Raju sir always taught us that-“A WINNER SEARCHES A SOLUTION FOR EVERY PROBLEM AND A LOOSER SEARCHES PROBLEM IN EVERY SOLUTION.”</p>

        <h2>Naman Shrimal</h2>
        <p>“Theatre & street plays”, a bunch of hooligans’ fooling around on street like sales representatives, trying to get attraction of crowd. Well that was my percepttion before meeting Raju Sir but today I believe that theatre is one medium which channelizes our hidden energy towards the ultimate goal of life i.e. self attainment.</p>
        <p>Earlier I was a person too shy to say anything, too ignorant of my own capabilities to achieve anything and too skeptical of my approach in the world of confident people.</p>
        <p>I always had ideas but not a channel to transform it into action. Theatre gave me that opening, it gave wings to my ideas and completely changed me.</p>
        <p>Theatre is not only about acting in somebody else’s role but it’s about discovering yourself .Its about finding what you have. They say you can buy a car, but you still need petrol to run the car. Theatre gave me that fuel, to aspire high and achieve.</p>
        <p>I still remember, when I first spoke on stage in 11th standard, my legs were shivering like strings of guitar. Theatre explained me, that my legs shivered not because I am frightened but because I have immense energy and I need to use that energy.</p>
        <p>I want to thank Raju Sir who has been a guiding spirit in my life, a person without whom I would not have become what I am now.</p>
        <p>Every human being has so much potential that he can achieve whatever he aspires. He just needs to find himself. Ten most inspiring words I always chant are</p>
        <blockquote>IF IT IS TO BE,<br />IT IS UP TO ME”</blockquote>

        <h2>Prapti</h2>
        <p>I was known as an introvert personality during my school days but when I joined THEATRE in my 11th standard things gradually changed. Acting is a way to explore a variety of roles.  By experiencing these roles I was able identify my weaknesses and strengths, and learn how to work with them, or change them to work in my favor. There are improvisation techniques, and incorporate games and exercises deployed in the theatre workshops which helped me to discover what strengths, I need to improve upon, and how best I can achieve my goal. I have been exposed to various facets of theatre, be it social, cultural, educational, my singing and dancing interest also got a place in theater; it was a great learning experience as it improved my overall personality. It helped me to sharpen my knowledge of my inner selves, which in turn will helped me to be more intuitive and aware of what is happening around me in everyday situations. This also helped me to empower the overall essence of who I am.  This will help empower us to play both the acting role and our life role. All this happened just because of a great director and a wonderful friend RAJU SIR thanks to him without his unconditional support and efforts these changes could not have been possible. But the most important and best part of theatre was fun, masti, dhamal, the whole group with raju sir made those moments of theatre an amazing phrase of our lives, a day long rehearsals, out trip for street plays, to Delhi, I can never forget that wonderful time of my life and this is very special.</p>
        <p>I am assured one will gain better interpersonal relationships and also gain better self-knowledge that will help one to define and achieve his/her goals. Someone said it so well…</p>
        <p>"Theatre is a social art that helps children express what they are and what they want to be, giving them a chance to explore their own talents and make them heard.”Theatre could be the best possible way to release children from psychological knots, simply because it provides them a space to express themselves freely," </p>
        <p>You will surely leave these theatre workshops with a new sense of confidence and a different individual.</p>

        <p>First class of theatre, we all gathered in a hall below the church of our school. Me still thinking standing aside, may be it was not a right decision while everyone else were busy talking about how the new teacher will be. And then there was a voice - “CIRCLE UP EVERYONE, HI! I’M RAJU KUMAR, YOUR THEATRE TEACHER”.Very normal looking person but with a loud and confident voice.</p>
        <p>Our first class started with a game. What has that to do with acting....that’s what I thought but in the next 10 minutes I was laughing, enjoying having fun. A different me. We were given a lot of creative exercises. I don’t know what it did to others but I learnt how to interact. And surprisingly people like me.</p>
        <p>This is how it went off,and with time Theatre completely changed me and from a shy,introvert guy to  a confident,extrovert and fun loving guy.</p>

        <h2>Shubham Jain</h2>
        <p>In this world there many people who are very shy, introvert, do not speak much and there presence is hardly felt among other people. Sometimes back I was also one of them. Except my friends, no one knew that I was in school, my teachers didn’t know my name and I was a quiet student.</p>
        <p>Then there was a turning point in life, we had theatre classes conducted by Raju sir in school. for many classes we used to have some exercises conducted and always thought that what these things have to with theatre acting but we didn’t knew that it was the way that Raju sir was grooming us and was trying to know us i.e. our strengths and weaknesses and where we lack behind. Then our theatre classes got started, doing theatre acting with sir was really fun and a learning experience.</p>
        <p>Slowly I don’t how did it happened and when did it happened, I was having a change in myself, and I could stand up and speak my view and also felt confident. I had the stage fear and that too was removed when I performed at so many places. Each and every time spent with sir was an amazing experience and I always cherish those moments.</p>
        <p>Today I had the guts that I can go and hold a mike in front of an audience and say whatever I want to. The credit goes to Raju sari doesn’t think without sir I would have been able to reach this level. Today whenever I speak in class people look at me because I have the confidence in my voice.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Raju sir for helping me in grooming myself otherwise I would have lost in the crowd just like any other simple guy.</p>

        <p>Theatre has been the turning point in my life. Something which has changed me from in and out is theatre, for almost 2 yrs during my schooling. Initially I was very unconfident and had stage fear. But gradually after attending theatre workshops I got to know my strengths and weaknesses. Theatre is not only about acting. In fact that’s the least concerned part. It actually changes you for better. It made me socially responsible and I learned how to be patient, when things are not on your side, how to communicate and cooperate with people. Specially the ones you don’t like much or haven’t met. Because doing plays is all about teamwork. And that’s the most important quality one needs to inculcate in himself whatsoever your field is you should know how to adjust with different people. Theatre has actually given me oodles of confidence really owe my whatever little success I have got in my life to theatre and Raju sir whom I truly idolize .just wanted to say that theatre can literally change one's life as it has changed mine.</p>

School level par hone wale plays me act karne se acting ka shouk lga par pta nhi tha ki rangmanch me bhi acchhe level par kaam kiya ja sakta hai. School me play sirf Saturday student meet ka hissa hota tha. School k baad saare frnds engineering ke liye ja rahe the to mai bhi unki nakal karne lga aur iit ki taiyari ke liye kota chala gya. Par andar he andar satisfy nhi tha kyon ki kahin na kahin acting ka keeda tha. Theatre mere liye junoon hai 2010 me mai leela se juda. Raju sir se mil k aisa lga jaise mujhe meri khoyi hui identity mil gyi. Pehle mujhe pta he nhi tha mai kya kar rha hu aur kyon kar rha hu? Leela se judne ke baad jeevan ka ek lakshya ban gya “ek behtareen actor banana” 10th ke baad jaise confidence khatm he ho gya par leela ne mujhe badal diya mere baat karne ka tarika mere uthne baithne ka tarika mere vichar meri  bhasha etc. har cheez jaise achhi lagne lagi. School ke baad mere ache dost leela se judne ke baad he bane. Aaj 3 year tak theatre karne ke baad proud feel hota hai ki mai ek actor banana ke process me hu aur raju sir bhi hamesha lakshya pane ke liye encourage karte rehte hai. Wo mere liye theatre teacher he nahi usase kahin zyada hai. Bas ab rukna nahi hai yu he sikhte hue kaam karna hai aur goal achive karna hai.</p>

        <h2>Samarth Sharma</h2>
        <p>Hello Guys!!</p>
        <p>This wasn't me 8 years ago. I used to be the person who was so introvert that even just a thought of getting on stage, fear used to pour in me. I used to start fumble between the lines; voice stammering; hands getting cold & wet and even the heart pounding like the drums. It was never easy for me to interact with girls and talk to them with full confidence and vigor.</p>
        <p>Still stage fear persists but when it comes to public speaking and interaction I have changed the thinking of my peer group. The foremost thing that ‘theatre’ taught me is to stand straight and be upright, which shows the confidence in the speaker with a right balance of weight on two legs. Theatre is not just about acting or learning dialogue delivery. It teaches team work, friendship, love and care for others and moreover living one’s life to the full.</p>
        <p>My experience of being a part of various Stage Drama’s & Street Plays was splendid where no one else but the audience is the real judge and gives you overwhelming response for the job you did. One of the best feelings one can’t express, is, when it comes to be a part of winning team almost every time in every event we participated. I miss those days of my life when and where I used to be on my own, take charge of things and do it with full zeal and passion, took decisions that benefitted team, learnt many fruitful lessons of life and the best one was the kind of mentor I got in my life.</p>
        <p>Trust & belief that he taught us in our life is surely the “Gold” which makes our lives wonderful, full of brightness and it’s worth it!!</p>

        <p><strong>Me &Leela- The Magical Theater Group</strong></p>
        <p>It has been approximately 1 year since I became active artist at RavindraManch. I had worked with various directors in couple of plays.During this time I came to know about Shri Raju Kumar sir. I knew that I was a good actor, but I can confess this that I was lacking spirit of a good human. An actor can’t become a great artist if he is not disciplined, if he lacks punctuality, if he can’t understand what honesty is, if he doesn’t respect humans.</p>
        <p>This is what Raju Sir taught me. This is what he blessed me with. He made me a good artist and brought out the human inside me. I can never forget what Raju Sir &Leela has given me.</p>

        <h2>Jyotsna Khatry</h2>
        <p>Theatre has often caused a lot of fights amongst children and parents. So, obviously my home was also subjected to it. We are all taught to look straight on the track and theatre was definitley not on the track..:P</p>
        <p>After a lot of fights and arguments at home I also decided to join CA preparation course but soon left it. That’s where I applied the first teaching of Raju Sir during theatre classes- Follow the path that you want to and not what the societal norms teach you.</p>
        <p>Theatre has taught me to ask “WHY”, word that we use less often once we grow up.</p>
        <p>Theatre for me is not an art of acting etc. For me it is like Hinduism which is a way of life. It helped me know my weaknesses and how to live comfortably with them not running away from them.</p>

        <p>A question which is always asked to me “What am I doing in theatre???”, as professionally I belong to psychology field. Answer is I am not learning how to act but with the guidance of Raju sir and being in Leela “The Magical Theatre Group” I have and I am still developing the qualities that are required to be a good psychologist and a counsellor. In a jot being a patient listener, resorting clashes, self-awareness, self-confidence, self-esteem, channelizing interaction, empathy, positive regard, cooperation, coordination and list goes on. As theatre is not just acting on stage but it is a dish that is garnished with team work and what makes it beautiful & tasty is proper communication and organisation. And also being the Creative Head of Leela, as an add-on topping I have improved and excelled my writing skills, presentation strength and above all, qualities of creative genre.</p>

        <p><strong>The thing that changed my life</strong></p>
        <p>Often, we meet some people who bring changes in our lives, changes that are good and which stay forever. For me, one such person indeed was Raju Sir, with his magical power of Theatre. Theatre was something that I, for one, never anticipated in my life.</p>
        <p>But when it came to theatre, Raju Sir was different. His opinion about theatre is not acting alone; it’s rather putting emotions to actions - for acting, music, dance or script writing. He believed that theatre cannot be taught so he considered himself also not a theatre teacher/instructor but a facilitator. He made us strong through several exercises that focused on self improvement and confidence building. This brought my ‘hidden inside’, out. The change in me was conspicuous to everyone. I am indebted to him for nurturing us with the charm of theatre.</p>
        <p>The confidence I gained while working with him, helped me sail through the journey for my aspired college and the dream B school.</p>
        <p>College started or rather continued with the same zeal. Theatre was a constant support and motivator. It helped me practice the things learnt in the form of street plays; class presentations; performing on the stage or anchoring. Life is nothing but an experience. His guidance helped me do better at every step and take my experience a step further. Not only had I improved as an artist, my people skills also improved with time.</p>
        <p>Raju sir lifted my confidence and inspired me to work with his eternal spirit and love towards theatre.</p>
        <p>To sum up, I believe that “cause-effect relationship” is the answer to every question in the world. Call this the cause or the action that I chose this path to contribute in my small way to change the world. Of what life I have seen till now, I have learnt that taking your commitments sincerely is an important thing and that it pays off. I believe that I am here today because I took my commitments sincerely one at a time, and I am grateful to god for that.</p>
        <p>I wish the mirror on the wall, helps you to recognize your own reflection. And I can easily assure you, the you are at the right most place for this job.</p>
        <p><em>Chamak us sooraj ki aakhir, kirno se hi hoti hai</em></p>
        <p>Wishing you all the luck in future under my lifetime MENTOR.</p>

        <p>My life, my identity, my name, “ANKUSH”, was lost somewhere or I was searching for a pathway. Though I was associated with theatre field but still that satisfaction was missing somewhere. It’s not just about working in this field, it’s all about right direction and proper guidance. I realized it when I came in contact with Mr. Raju Kumar and started working with LEELA Group. After being the part of different annual productions, workshops, school based theatre activities and theatre in education programs conducted by Leela Group I have felt a kind of transformation in my personality and my attitude towards life. I am still a learner but now I know where I stand, what are my assets and my potentials. Now I know who ANKUSH is and this confidence has been developed during my journey with leela.</p>

        <h2>Abhishek Somvansi</h2>
        <p>To be honest most of my qualities which people acknowledge are bestowed upon me by theatre. For me theatre gives a sense of freedom from our own restrictions and boundaries which we have created around us and help us to unfold the layers of happiness that lies within us….With time I have realized how much a theatre set me on the road towards success. It taught me to value the every single effort of each individual… I have encountered the most amazing and stimulating cross-section of humanity in theatre. The great thing about the stage is that when it’s live and you’re up in front of that audience anything can, and does, happen.  Dropped lines, missed entrances, or malfunctioning props require you to improvise while maintaining yours cool. Theatre taught me how to focus, think quickly and make do while giving the impression that you’ve got it all under control.   It’s not the road to fortune. Many Plays have shoestring budget. Though its theatre which have taught me how to be imaginative, do more with less and to give my best shot with what I have got. Being a soft skill trainer, and moreover a social being I  have to appreciate, understand and effectively communicate with a widely diverse group of social beings with being motivating and a little entertaining that has ultimately made me a better (though far from perfect) mankind in every role which could not be possible without theatre.</p>
