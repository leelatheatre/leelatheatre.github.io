              <p>Band Member “Silver Desert”</p>
              <p>Silver Desert was formed late in 2011 when we started off things with a basic 6 piece line doing slow rock/alternative covers.Gradually we discovered our potentials and did some hard rock covers which influenced us as we composed our originals. Later on due to the line up changes we started experimenting and improvising things within our originals which led us to create new things and finally it became a 4 piece band. We never felt like sticking to only one genre as we loved to compose and cover Hindi rock/Hard rock/Progressive/Metal/Alternative ,so we kept on doing the slow rock covers.We are a multi- genre band and we just love to perform LIVE.</p>

              <p>The only thing you truly posses in this world is yourself. Don’t let anything to take it from you. I being a writer and a research scholar employ myself towards the betterment of this society. I strongly believe in giving a student not just an opportunity but opportunities to recognize its talent and to work on them. Theatre is something that took my interest quite recently and "Leela" is providing me a platform to develop my tastes in it. There are no less hard-workers in the world but innovators. What you do doesn’t make a difference; how you do something mesmerizes the entire world.</p>
